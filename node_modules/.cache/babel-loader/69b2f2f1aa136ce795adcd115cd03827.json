Now that grad school is over and my skills have \r\n                    improved, I wanted to build something a bit more polished because \r\n                    the content needed updating and the CSS needed work.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <hr/>\r\n            <div className=\"project-panel\">\r\n                <h3>Refactor & Complete: UMich Crime Corpus</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    University of Michigan's on-campus police force has a mini-app on\r\n                    their website that's used to publish crime data, daily, going all\r\n                    the way back to January of 2000. The downside is, it's slow, has \r\n                    no search capacity, and is a pain to even browse because you can\r\n                    only view one date worth of records at a time, and can only step \r\n                    back month-by-month through a calendar-esque interface.\r\n\r\n                    I decided to start experimenting with a project to basically extract \r\n                    all of the daily-published crime data from UMich's campus police \r\n                    department, which is only available through a severely lame endpoint,\r\n                    store it in my own database, and make it searchable, visualizable, etc.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I scraped approximately one year's worth of data into a Mongo \r\n                    database, wrote up an API with Node/Express, and used React to\r\n                    build the user-facing part of the website.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    When the school-year started, I got so busy that I didn't really\r\n                    get to the last bit of development and deployment, so now that I have\r\n                    time for extra projects, I'm reviewing what I wrote, improving in\r\n                    some areas I'm more capable in now, and actually get the thing deployed.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <h2>Past Projects</h2>\r\n            <div className=\"project-panel\">\r\n                <h3>San Francisco Predictive Crime Classification</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    As part of a group project for our Exploratory Data Analysis course,\r\n                    we had to pick a Kaggle dataset and build a project out of it. As \r\n                    multiple of us were interested in crime, law, and policy, we chose to\r\n                    use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/data\"> San Francisco\r\n                    Crime Classification</a> competition as a base and set out to build both \r\n                    an interactive visualization and a predictive classifier.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    We achieved reasonable performance with our best classifier, a \r\n                    grid-tuned random forest model, which revealed location (coordinates \r\n                    and district) and season as some of the most significant features.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    For our visualization component, we used Folium to build maps \r\n                    <a href=\"http://www.si370finalproject.xyz\"> here</a>.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <hr/>                            \r\n            <div className=\"project-panel\">\r\n                <h3>Green Wolverine Fund - Market Research Web Scraper</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I did a project for the Green Wolverine Fund within Ross School of\r\n                    Business to help with investigating what the product diversity of\r\n                    legal cannabis dispensaries within the state of Michigan. \r\n                    I identified a platform that an apparent majority of retailers \r\n                    used to list their product offerings to customers as a data source.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Using Python and Selenium's chrome webdriver to dig through \r\n                    hub pages representing four of the cities with the most retailers \r\n                    and scraped data from each retailer listed therein. The difficult\r\n                    part was that the platform seemingly was designed against being \r\n                    scraped. I had to put a lot of effort into simulating clicks, \r\n                    scrolling cycles, waiting for load-ins, etc.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p style={{marginBottom: '8px'}}>\r\n                    I was also able to find a database of attributes of certain \r\n                    \"strains\" that could augment records for herbal product so \r\n                    we could aggregate and report on things like popularly-offered\r\n                    flavors or effects.
