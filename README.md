# Personal Site Repo

This is basically the repo where I'm rewriting my personal site and administering it with Github Pages.

## To-Do

- Figure out how to setup so I can deploy via Github Pages but still use my custom domain name from the old site
- Run responsive-design assessment
- Run accessibility assessment for tabbing, voiceovers
- Potentially move some repeatable content into JSON and create elements from that rather than hardcode
