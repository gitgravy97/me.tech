    <h2>Senior Capstone Project -- Unemployment Tracker</h2>
    <p>
        <b>What:</b> Working with a team of two other graduating seniors in the informatics program's data analytics subconcentration, we were assigned a client and final project.
        I can't go super in-depth due to the NDA, but we spent many hours working on cleaning and processing a massive amount of data regarding unemployment insurance, claims, and claimancy protests to build insight systems for internal use.
    </p>
    <p><b>Why:</b> I've always been interested in law and business, have had a growing interest in finance and insurance, and selecting this client seemed a great way to apply my technical skills to one of my other veins of interest</p>
    <p><b>
        How:</b> A mix of Pandas, statistics, sklearn for machine learning purposes, and so, so, so so so much RegEx / Regular Expression work... so many regular expressions...

    <h2>Kaggle Competition -- San Francisco Crime Classification</h2>
    <p>
        <b>What:</b> Working with four classmates in (SI370) Exploratory Data Analysis, we built a project for the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/data">San Francisco Crime Classification</a> Kaggle competition.<br>
        In addition to a ML classifier that can predict the category of a given crime (from a pool of 39 established categories) based largely on temporal and geolocational data, we have built out interactive maps to visualize the data.
    </p>
    <p><b>Why:</b> Group selection-by-vote and a rather mutual interest in criminal data</p>
    <p><b>
        How:</b> The data was cleaned primarily with Pandas. Our classifier of choice ended up being the SKLearn's Random Forest Classifier. The visualization component was build with Folium.

    <h2>Michigan Cannabis Market Research</h2>
    <p>
        <b>What:</b> I aggregated publicly-available data regarding dispensary product offerings and pricing for four Michigan localities:
        Ann Arbor, Bay City, East Lansing, and Flint. I used these aggregates to create the visualizations linked below.
    </p>
    <p><b>Why:</b> Aside from Michigan having an active proposal at the time (Prop1) to recreationally legalize cannabis, I was getting curious about investment and a friend mentioned that
    they were part of a fund that was open to considering students as new members, but was a fund that focused specifically on cannabis venture investment. I realized I had absolutely no idea what
    dispensaries actually sold, so I decided to do a project to investigate product diversity by mining online menu data.</p>
    <p><b>Experience:</b></p>

    <h2>DPSS Data Analysis</h2>
    <p><b>Note:</b> I've actually decided to rewrite this project this summer and host it online, time permitting, because my old implementation was dicey and also not-publicly-hosted anywhere.</p>
    <p>
        <b>What:</b> I collected ~2-3 years worth of public-disclosure data published by campus law enforcement.<br>
        I tagged incident reports based on crime type and location to understand what types of crime were most common on campus,
        as well as which dorms had the most incident reports tagged to their building
    </p>
    <p><b>Why:</b> I've always been fascinated with law and crime. I've also been living on campus for most of my university experience.</p>
    <p><b>
        How:</b> Python used to collect data from API, mapped and reduced crime types due to variable naming conventions,
        Flask used for making the application
